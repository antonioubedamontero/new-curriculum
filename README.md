# NewCurriculum

Application to show personal Antonio Ãšbeda Montero curriculum vitae.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve -o (or npm run start)
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`, or another port if port is being used by another web app instance.

The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Generate pre render

```npm run build:prod```

To serve in development:

```npm run serve:ssr:new-curriculum```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```
